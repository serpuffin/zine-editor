# DotMatrix

**DotMatrix** is a font inspired by the dot matrix printers of the 1980s, capturing the essence of the printing technologies from that era. It's perfect for evoking a retro or nostalgic feel, rendering ASCII/ANSI art, or use within code editors. For true scale, use **10 point text**.

## Features

* **Character Set**: Includes 537 characters featuring the full set from the Epson FX-80 printer, DOS code page 437, Google Fonts Latin Core, Greek Core, Cyrillic Core, and Hebrew. Note, the italic subset is limited to 191 characters due to historical constraints.

* **Dot Jitter**: Simulates the inaccuracy of the printing head for an authentic look.

* **Epson FX-80 Modes**: Mapped to different DotMatrix font families:
