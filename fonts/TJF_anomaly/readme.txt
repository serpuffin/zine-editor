TJF Anomaly is my attempt to rejuvenate the true spirit of the late Herb Lubalin. Don't get me wrong, I'm glad his fonts have been digitally archived, but all of them with the exception of Avant Garde Gothic have no alternates or ligatures! And they're all spaced for body text, making them essentially useless, unless you want to go through the effort of spacing everything yourself. Anomaly solves this problem by being tight as a belt right out of the box. Complete with a couple of stylistic alternates and extra ligatures, if you want to set a heading like it's 1974, Anomaly is your guy.
