LEFT HAND is a freely designed handwriting typeface created to evoke a sense of freedom and space, breaking traditional lines and experimenting with varying sizes, making it unsuitable for perfectionists. Perfect for designs aiming to express an organic and free expression, it adds a personal and unique touch. ​​​​​​​ 
Available for both personal and commercial use.
