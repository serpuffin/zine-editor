# Shehroz-Font

[![Build Status](https://app.cloudback.it/badge/xehroz/Shehroz-Font)](https://cloudback.it)

**Shehroz-Font** is an open-source experimental font project rooted in handwriting, typography, and **neography** — the practice of creating new ways of writing.

Both fonts in this repository are personal experiments. They are unfinished by design, sometimes inconsistent, and often deliberately broken. The goal here is not to polish a system, but to question it.

## ⚠️ A Quick Heads-Up

Everything in this repository is **experimental**.

These fonts may change suddenly, break rules, ignore conventions, or behave unpredictably in real-world use. If you’re looking for something stable or production-ready, this probably isn’t it — and that’s okay.

## What’s in This Repository

### Shehroz Font (English)
This font started as an attempt to digitize my own handwriting. It slowly turned into an experiment in imbalance, rhythm, and imperfection.

Some letters don’t behave. Some proportions don’t make sense. That’s intentional.

This font is about expression more than correctness.

---

### Shehroz Urdu Font — Neographic Experiment
The Urdu font is a deeper experiment in **neography**.

Instead of following existing Urdu scripts, this work explores what happens when you try to *invent a new way of writing Urdu*. Letterforms, joins, and structure are questioned — and sometimes broken entirely.

This is not meant to replace traditional Urdu writing. It’s an exploration of what Urdu *could* look like if the rules were different.

Readability is secondary. Exploration comes first.

## How to Think About This Project

This repository treats fonts as:
- Ongoing experiments  
- Personal investigations  
- Living, changing systems  

Things may improve, regress, or change direction completely. That’s part of the process.
